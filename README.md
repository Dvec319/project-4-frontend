## Description

Welcome to Favorite Athlete Holder! I created this project because I've recently gotten into Fantasy Football with some family and friends of mine. This sparked my interest in potentially doing other fantasy sports and figured this would be a good place to hold all of the players I'd be interested in or have on all the teams I have if I'm in multiple leagues! A nice solution for myself to keep everything in one spot instead of having to spread it out over multiple apps. And if you're interested too, go ahead and fork this repo and clone it down!

## Future Enhancements

I'd like to add the ability to sort the athletes by any of the data points used for entry. Name, age, anything that's put in.
